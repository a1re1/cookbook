Using a meat mallet, pound out the meat. Season the steak with salt and pepper. Combine the egg with 3 tablespoons of the milk. Put 1 1/2 cups of the flour in a shallow pan and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the steaks in the flour, coating each piece evenly and tapping off any excess. Drip the steak in the egg wash, coating it completely and letting the excess drip off. Dredge again in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Fry the steaks in the hot oil, until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Carefully pour off the oil, leaving behind about 1/4 cup of the oil along with the brown bits.  Over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, whisking constantly. Add the remaining 3 cups milk, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Season with salt and plenty of pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking constantly. The gravy should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it is too thick, add a little water to thin it.  Serve the fried steak and gravy with mashed potatoes and green beans.\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"002f978f-a0d4-4e55-8fb2-277c3785716f\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Cheese Straws\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> From Let’s Pig Out Cookbook\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Cheese Straws\\\\n\\\\n## Appetizers\\\\n\\\\n> From Let’s Pig Out Cookbook\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 3 cookie sheets_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* ½ lb. butter (2 sticks) (room temperature)\\\\n* 1 lb. grated cheddar cheese (room temperature)\\\\n* 3 cups flour\\\\n* 1 tsp. cayenne pepper\\\\n* 2 tsp. baking powder\\\\n* 3 tsp. garlic salt\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* In a large mixing bowl, cream butter; add grated cheese and beat thoroughly.

In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of the milk and 8 tablespoons of the butter together. Using an electric mixer with a wire whip, combine the 32 eggs and 8 cups of sugar together. Beat on medium-high speed for about 8 minutes, or until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume. With the machine running, slowly add the heated milk. In a mixing bowl, sift 4 cups flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder and 4 teaspoons salt together. Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth. Fold in the vanilla. Grease 4 (1/2-sheet) pans with 8 teaspoons of the butter. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched. Cool for about 2 minutes.

Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Be forewarned: the mixture will break, don’t be alarmed. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap over the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely at room temperature. When cooled, remove the vanilla bean and pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer with a wire whip. Beat at medium speed to combine the mixture. If the mixture will not combine, warm another cup of heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture.

(Can substitute fried onions)\\\\n* While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.\\\\n* Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes.\\\\n* Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions. Place into the oven and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"036b731d-6c34-4553-a950-f21e99b03cce\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Chicken Nuggets\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Recipe Courtesy Sara Moulton\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Chicken Nuggets\\\\n\\\\n## Main Dishes\\\\n\\\\n> Recipe Courtesy Sara Moulton\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* Basic Seasoned Flour:\\\\n* 1 cup flour \\\\n* 2 teaspoons salt\\\\n* 1 teaspoon pepper\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Variations:\\\\n* Chili-Fried Chicken: Prepare as directed, adding 1 tablespoon chili powder to seasoned flour.\\\\n* Curry-Fried Chicken: Prepare as directed, adding 2 to 3 teaspoons curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon ginger to seasoned flour.\\\\n* Cheesy-Fried Chicken: Prepare as directed, reducing flour in seasoned flour to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon oregano or marjoram.\\\\n* Crisp-Fried Chicken: Dip pieces of chicken in buttermilk, or light cream, then dredge in self-rising flour and fry as directed. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"049cde7b-016f-48f7-bb85-35196a04b111\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Pizza Dough\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Emeril Lagasse, 2000\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Pizza Dough\\\\n\\\\n## Breads\\\\n\\\\n> Emeril Lagasse, 2000\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 4 servings_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 1 cup warm water, about 110 degrees F \\\\n* 1 packet dry yeast \\\\n* 1 tablespoon sugar \\\\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil \\\\n* 2 1/4 cups flour (may use a little more or less) \\\\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* To the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the warm water and yeast and sugar and stir to dissolve the yeast.

Remove pan from heat and stir rapidly until mixture thickens. Drop pralines by teaspoonfuls, 1-inch apart onto parchment paper-lined baking sheets; let cool completely until firmed up.

Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding, covering it entirely to prevent a skin from forming on the surface. Let cool for 15 minutes. Remove the plastic, stir well and pour the mixture into the pie shell. Whip the cream (if using) just before serving and spread it over the pie.

Stir to combine. Add flour, one cup at a time to yeast mixture. Mix using a wooden spoon until thick (each addition of flour makes stirring more difficult). Continue adding 1/2 cup flour until dough is no longer sticky. On a floured surface or in the bowl, knead dough for 2-3 minutes. Shape into a ball. With a sharp knife, cut dough into desired sizes. For the size shown here, I did about 1/3 cup. You get 18 pretzels with this size.\\\\n* Roll each dough piece into a rope. Grab ends of rope and curl rope into a circle. Twist rope ends once and stick them to bottom of pretzel. They don’t have to be mashed together, but a few pinches at each connection makes the rest of the process much easier.\\\\n* Dunk the pretzels 1-2 at a time into baking soda bath for 30 seconds. Using a spatula or spoon with holes makes dunking and removing the pretzels from the hot bath much easier.\\\\n* Dunk both side of the pretzels into egg wash.

Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Put the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar, bring to a boil and cook until the temperature reaches 260 degrees F on a candy thermometer, or the hard-ball stage, when a bit of the mixture dropped into cold water holds its shape, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Pour in a thin steady stream into the beaten egg whites and beat with an electric mixer on high for about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla, and continue beating on high just until the candy starts to lose its gloss, 5 to 6 minutes. When the beaters are lifted, the mixture should fall in a ribbon that mounds on itself. \\\\n* **TIP: If the mixture flattens out, beat again for 1 minute more.

Stir to dissolve and set aside. In an electric mixer, beat the eggs and remaining 3/4 cup sugar until thick and pale yellow in color. Change the mixer attachment to a dough hook. With the machine running slowly add the yeast mixture, melted butter, salt, milk, and half-and-half. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix until the mixture forms a soft ball, leaves the sides of the bowl, and climbs up the dough hook. Remove the dough and turn into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm, draft free space. Let the dough rise until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and dust the surface of the dough with flour. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough, about 1/4-inch thick, in the shape of a rectangle. Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut the dough into circles. Place the rounds on a baking sheet. Cover the dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap (this will prevent the dough from sticking to the wrap) and let the dough rise until double in size, about 30 minutes. Preheat the fryer to 350 degrees. Gently fry a couple of the circles at a time, until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, flipping occasionally for overall browning. Remove the doughnuts from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Fit each pastry bag with small round tips. Fill each bag with a different filling. Pipe the doughnuts, alternately with the different fillings. Sprinkle some of the filled doughnuts with powdered sugar. Glaze the remaining donuts with the 2 different glazes. Serve on a large serving platter. \\\\n* In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and 1 cup of the heavy cream. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Be forewarned: the mixture will break. Don’t be alarmed. Pour it into a glass bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely at room temperature. When cooled pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip. Beat at a medium speed to combine the mixture. If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture. Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. \\\\n* RASPBERRY FILLING: 4 cups raspberries 1 cup water 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch \\\\n* In a saucepan, combine raspberries, 3/4 cup of water and sugar. Bring to boil. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until raspberries have broken down. Remove mixture from the heat and strain out the seeds. Return the strained mixture to the heat. Dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup of water. Whisk the slurry into the raspberry mixture. Bring the mixture back to a boil. Simmer for 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"44183ae7-dfca-4853-b9bb-53bf04416cc9\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Emeril’s Lobster Cheesecake\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Emeril Lagasse 1999\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Emeril’s Lobster Cheesecake\\\\n\\\\n## Desserts\\\\n\\\\n> Emeril Lagasse 1999\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 12 to 16 servings_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\\\\n* 1 cup bread crumbs\\\\n* 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter\\\\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\\\\n* 1 cup chopped onions\\\\n* 1/2 cup chopped yellow bell peppers\\\\n* 1/2 cup chopped red bell peppers\\\\n* 2 teaspoons salt\\\\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n* 1 3/4 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature\\\\n* 4 large eggs\\\\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream\\\\n* 1 cup grated Smoked Gouda cheese\\\\n* 1 pound (about 2 cups) cooked lobster meat, roughly chopped\\\\n* 1/2 cup chopped parsley\\\\n* 2 cups Crème Fraiche\\\\n* 2 hard boiled eggs, finely chopped\\\\n* 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves\\\\n* 1/4 cup small diced red onions\\\\n* 7 ounces Osetra caviar\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\\\\n* In a mixing bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs and butter, blend thoroughly.

Add 1 cup flour and mix to blend well. Using a knife, scrape the vanilla bean and stir the pulp into the yeast mixture. Let sit at room temperature in a warm, draft-free place for about 2 hours to allow fermentation. Put 2 cups of the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add 4 of the eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly into the flour using a wooden spoon with each addition The dough will be sticky, thick, and spongy. Add the water, sugar, and salt and mix well, beating vigorously. Add 3 sticks of the butter and work it into the dough with your hands until it is well blended. Add the remaining 2 eggs and mix well into the dough. Add the remaining 2 cups of flour and blend into the dough, breaking up any lumps with your fingers. Add the yeast mixture. Using your hands, knead and fold the starter into the dough. Continue kneading and folding until all is well mixed, about 5 minutes. The dough will be sticky and moist. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size, about 2 hours. With your fingers, lightly punch down the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. \\\\n* To assemble: Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Refrigerate one ball of dough while working with the other. Lightly dust the work surface with flour and roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 14 inches long and 1/4-inch thick. Using a pastry brush, egg wash the edges of the dough. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Mix well. Sprinkle half of the mixture over 3/4 of the dough. Roll the dough up tightly to form a log. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and freeze for 30 minutes. Repeat the above process with the other ball of dough. In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix well. Smear the bottom of 2 (10-inch) round cake pan with the butter mixture. Sprinkle the butter with the pecan pieces. Remove the logs from the refrigerator. Using a sharp knife, slice into 1 1/2-inch slices. Place the slices on top of the pecans, about 1/2-inch away from each other. Let the buns rise until double in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes.

You will have to fill the syringe several times. \\\\n* Next, combine the seasoning ingredients and rub the mixture evenly all over each turkey. \\\\n* Place the turkeys in large plastic bags and secure before icing them down or refrigerating them for 24 hours. \\\\n* To fry each turkey:\\\\n* Fill a large pot three quarters of the way full with the peanut oil and heat the oil to between 350( and 360 degrees F. Place 1 turkey in the basket insert and carefully and slowly lower it into the hot oil. Turn the turkey every 10 minutes, using long-handled forks. A whole turkey will take 3 to 5 minutes per pound to cook. It is done when the internal temperature reaches 170 to 180 degrees F on an instant read meat thermometer. Carefully lift the basket out of the hot oil. This can be done by inserting a broomstick through the handles and having two strong people lift the basket out of the pot. Using the long-handled forks, transfer the turkey to a large brown paper bag and let stand for about 15 minutes before removing to carve. Repeat the procedure for the second turkey. Carve the turkey and serve with the other traditional side items. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nFor the Marinade:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"5185c3a9-c084-420c-b665-9f1cc1883c12\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Green Bean Casserole\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Recipe Courtesy of Cathy Lowe\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Green Bean Casserole\\\\n\\\\n## Vegetables\\\\n\\\\n> Recipe Courtesy of Cathy Lowe\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 6 servings_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 1 large bags of frozen green beans, cut or french style, thawed \\\\n* 2 tablespoons butter \\\\n* 1/2 cup chopped onion \\\\n* 2 cups sliced mushrooms \\\\n* 1 can cream of mushroom soup \\\\n* 1 cup heavy cream \\\\n* 1 cup white Cheddar cheese \\\\n* 1 can fried onion rings (durkee \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* In a skillet, melt butter and Cook onions for 2 minutes.

Place the prepared sauce on one edge of the grill to keep warm. Do not boil. Place the oysters on the grill 8-10 at a time and close the lid. In 2-3 minutes the oysters should begin to pop open. Using a grill glove, remove the oysters from the grill and pop open the outer shell using an oyster knife. Top with 1/4 tsp of the sauce and serve hot. Note: For a patio party I recommend having 6 oyster knives along with 6 heavy-duty gloves or kitchen towels in order to hold the hot oysters as they are removed from the grill.

Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3.  At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one.  Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it’s a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 2 cups_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 1 cup red wine \\\\n* 2 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable broth \\\\n* 1 bay leaf \\\\n* 5 to 6 black peppercorns \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"87db213f-9c9e-4117-ab90-e70b5aaa4ba5\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Mississippi Sin\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Favorite Recipes from Union Baptist Church Cooks\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Mississippi Sin\\\\n\\\\n## Appetizers\\\\n\\\\n> Favorite Recipes from Union Baptist Church Cooks Tylertown, Mississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Makes about 4 cups of dip._\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, (8 oz) \\\\n* 1 package cream cheese, softened, (8 oz) \\\\n* 1 1/2 cups sour cream \\\\n* 1/2 cup chopped cooked ham \\\\n* 1/3 cup chopped green chilies \\\\n* 1/3 cup chopped green onions \\\\n* 1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce \\\\n* 1 (1-lb) round loaf French bread \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Combine first 7 ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring well.

On a lightly floured surface roll the dough to a 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Line the pie plate, being sure to press the dough into the bottom and up the sides without stretching. Chill 30 minutes. Roughly chop the apples into small pieces, about the size of lima beans. (The apples should measure about 9 cups chopped.) Combine with the sugar, tapioca, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside until the juices begin to run, about 10 - 15 minutes. Beat together the cream and egg to make a glaze and brush over the edges and bottom of the crust. Mound the apple filling in the pie shell. It will be quite full. Roll out the remaining dough to a large round about 1/8’’ thick. Place over the filling a seal the edges together by gently pressing together. Trim any excess dough with scissors and flute the edges. Brush the top with the remaining egg glaze. Using a paring knife, cut out and remove a circle the size of a quarter from the center of the top crust. Cut 5 or 6 slits in a spoke pattern beginning 1/2-inch from the center hole and ending 1/2-inch from the outside edge. Chill for 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place the pie plate on a cookie sheet and bake 10 - 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until the juice visible in the center becomes thick and bubbly, about 1 hour (if the edges are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil). Meanwhile prepare the caramel topping. Spoon the hot caramel over the top of the pie to coat and return to the oven. Bake 5 minutes longer, or until the caramel sets. Cool on a rack before serving.\\\\n* In a small saucepan combine brown sugar, butter and cream. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecan halves. \\\\n* In a large bowl combine the flour with the lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grape-sized pieces. You should be able to see chunks of fat. Stir in the iced water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more iced water if necessary. Transfer to a plastic bag and shape into a log. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, and chill for as little as 1 hour or as long as 3 days. The pie dough can be frozen for as long as a week. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"898e8a7e-da08-47bc-82d3-02f5ca6e0c3d\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Seven Layer Salad\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"***\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Seven Layer Salad\\\\n\\\\n## Salads\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* ½ head iceberg lettuce (bite size)\\\\n* ½ cup celery, chopped\\\\n* 1 bell pepper, chopped\\\\n* 1 10oz pkg. frozen peas, thawed\\\\n* ½ medium onion, finely chopped\\\\n* 1 cup Helmanns mayonnaise\\\\n* ¼ cup salad oil\\\\n* 2 tablespoons sugar\\\\n* ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, grated\\\\n* 1 cup cheddar cheese, grated\\\\n* 8 slices bacon, fried crisp\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Layer lettuce, celery, pepper, peas, and onions in a 9” X 13” pan.

Add the baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Sift all into a bowl. Weigh out 3 ounces of chilled lard and break it into 1- inch chunks. Cut the lard into the flour with 2 knives or a pastry cutter. Fold in the buttermilk in 3 parts. ( Use 1/4 cup more buttermilk if necessary.) Only fold in the buttermilk until it’s just blended. Work lightly.  Lightly dust the table with flour. (Use as little flour as possible) Work the dough with fingertips only until it just holds together. Roll out dough 1/2-inch thick. Dip biscuit cutter in flour and punch out 12 biscuits.  Don’t use a glass to punch out the biscuits and don’t twist the cutter. You need a clean cut that doesn’t compress the dough so the biscuits will rise easily.  You can stack scraps and roll them out in order to cut more biscuits. Put biscuits on ungreased baking sheet.  Put the biscuits close together but not touching. If they’re too close, the edges won’t cook and the biscuits will have a cakey texture - too far apart and they’ll brown too soon and be raw in the middle.  Bake at 450 degrees.

Remove the Dutch oven from the heat, stir in the reserved shrimp and chicken, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer the jambalaya to a warmed serving bowl, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nCook’s Notes: There’s something about serving jambalaya at a party that almost guarantees the good times will roll. As it’s difficult to decide just what kind of jambalaya to make (meat, shellfish, or poultry), we normally put a little bit of everything into the pot. (Not one to complicate matters, but you can use 1 cup chopped smoked ham instead of the sausage. Or you could stir in 1/2 pound cooked crabmeat at the end to replace the shrimp.) \\\\n\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"98e90e01-9003-43e4-8d83-af5f5f8400e8\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Grandma Alma’s Chicken And Dumplings\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"> Catherine Cora, Executive Chef/Partner, Postino,\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Grandma Alma’s Chicken And Dumplings\\\\n\\\\n## Main Dishes\\\\n\\\\n> Catherine Cora, Executive Chef/Partner, Postino, Lafayette, CATake the skin from the chicken and put in a pan with 1/4 cup of water and render.

Heat 2 tablespoons shortening in an iron skillet, muffin pan, or other baking pan. Combine the cornmeal, flour, and salt in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, milk, and egg. Add the baking powder and baking soda. Stir. Add the remaining 1/4 cup melted shortening, stirring constantly. Pour into the hot pan, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.\\\\n* Serves 18 servings\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nAllow the diced bread to sit out on sheet pans for several hours or overnight, until dried out. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with the canola oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt; mushrooms will be very coated. Divide the mushrooms between 2 sheet pans and roast in the upper half of the oven for at least 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through roasting. Remove from the oven when the mushrooms are deep brown. Set aside. Reduce the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium-high heat until the fat is rendered and pancetta is golden brown. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Without cleaning the skillet, add in the onions and brown for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the apples, brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Decrease the heat to medium and pour in the wine (be careful if you’re using an open flame). Stir and cook to reduce the liquid by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the apple/onion mixture into a bowl and set aside. Return the skillet to medium heat (again, without washing) and add the chicken broth, thyme, turmeric, rosemary, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Heat for a few minutes, and then set aside. Add the bread to a large bowl, and then add the browned pancetta, mushrooms, and apple/onion mixture (and any juices that might have accumulated). Next, add the broth mixture gradually as you toss the ingredients, being prepared not to use all of the liquid, according to your taste. Check the seasonings at the end and add in the minced parsley. Pour into a large baking dish or iron skillet and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.

Invert onto a platter, then invert again (the nuts should be on the bottom). The cake can be kept in the refrigerator up to 2 days. At least two or up to eight hours before serving, top with the melted chocolate: Dip your fingers or a fork into the melted chocolate and drizzle over the center in a freeform pattern.

If so, turn dough out onto aluminum foil that has been either floured, lightly buttered, or lightly sprayed with cooking spray. Roll up foil until it is sealed and refrigerate. Don’t be surprised if your biscuits rise even higher because the baking powder has had more time to act in the dough. Be Patient with yourself.

In a large bowl, using a wooden spoon, mix softened butter and peanut butter together until butter disappears. Add Rice Krispies and confectioners’ sugar a cupful at a time. Mix as long as possible with the wooden spoon. Eventually you will have to use your hands. Knead and incorporate the sugar and cereal, squeezing the dough until it starts to hang together or your hands cramp beyond the point of no return.  Form the mixture into eggs about the size of a small hen’s egg or elongated walnut. Squeeze together tightly, making the egg as compact and smooth as possible. Place on waxed paper lined cookie sheets and chill loosely covered for at least one hour (or overnight).  Melt chocolate chips in a small, heavy saucepan over lowest possible heat.  When the chips begin to melt, remove from heat; stir. Return to heat for a few seconds at a time, stirring until smooth. Optional: For the best consistency, ease of coating and beautiful luster, add about 1 tablespoon grated (use the carrot grater) Gulf Seal or other canning grade wax (no candles, please!) to the melting chocolate chips. The chocolate will be thinner and more manageable. One tablespoon solid shortening may be substituted for the wax. Remove the saucepan from the burner and place on a potholder. Cradle an egg on a fork (preferably a two-pronged meat fork) and hold it over the saucepan.  With a small spoon, ladle the melted chocolate over the egg covering top and sides completely. Don’t worry about the bottom of the egg - it is not critical that it be covered completely. Let excess chocolate drain through the tines of the fork back into the saucepan. Gently slide the dipped egg onto a waxed paper lined tray. Repeat, returning the saucepan to the heat for a few seconds if chocolate starts to thicken.  Let chocolate set until \\\\\\\"dry.\\\\\\\" You may refrigerate to speed the process. Devoted egg makers may wish to decorate finished eggs with decorator’s icing.  All chocolate, including your chocolate eggs, store best in a cool, dark place. If you don’t have such a place, store them loosely covered in the refrigerator. Before serving, leave them out uncovered (to reduce condensation) to reach room temperature. Like cheese, the candy will be softer, creamier and tastier if allowed to reach room temperature before eating. However, this may be difficult to police.\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"c24c6e14-a5e7-433c-a0b4-4942d80202ba\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Egg Rolls\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"_Yield: 10 servings/2 per person_\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# Egg Rolls\\\\n\\\\n## Appetizers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Yield: 10 servings/2 per person_\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\\\n* 1 pound ground pork\\\\n* Salt\\\\n* Freshly ground black pepper\\\\n* 1/2 cup minced yellow onions\\\\n* 1 tablespoon chopped garlic\\\\n* 1 pound Bok Choy, shredded\\\\n* 1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and chopped\\\\n* Soy sauce, to taste\\\\n* 1/4 cup Sake\\\\n* 1 tablespoon sugar\\\\n* 1 pound fresh bean sprouts, washed and patted dry\\\\n* 1/4 cup green onions, green part only\\\\n* 20 (6-inch) egg roll wrappers\\\\n* 1 egg, beaten\\\\n* Oil for frying\\\\n* 1 cup Sweet and Sour Sauce\\\\n* 1/2 cup Mustard Sauce \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Preheat the fryer.

Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don’t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a teaspoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, “paint: a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don’t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm.\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\"}\",\"{\\\"id\\\":\\\"c6c5cab1-2bf5-4898-aad5-e8cb1decc507\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"All Crabmeat\\\\\\\" Crab Cakes\\\",\\\"image\\\":null,\\\"description\\\":\\\"_Makes 8 cakes._\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[],\\\"content\\\":\\\"# \\\\\\\"All Crabmeat\\\\\\\" Crab Cakes\\\\n\\\\n## Main Dishes\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n_Makes 8 cakes._\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Ingredients:\\\\n\\\\n* Recipe Courtesy of Executive Chef Edward Brown, The SeaGrill \\\\n* 1 1/2 cups cornflake crumbs \\\\n* 1 pound jumbo lump crabmeat \\\\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons homemade mayonnaise, or best-quality store-bought \\\\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning \\\\n* 1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper \\\\n* 1 large egg yolk \\\\n* 1 tablespoon red bell pepper, cored, seeded, finely diced \\\\n* 1 tablespoon yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded and finely diced \\\\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh chives \\\\n* 1/4 teaspoon minced jalapeZo pepper \\\\n* 2 teaspoons unsalted butter \\\\n* True orange sabayon sauce (recipe to follow) \\\\n* Tartar sauce or spicy honey mustard sauce \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n# Directions:\\\\n\\\\n* Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a shallow platter, combine the buttermilk, water, and red pepper sauce. Soak the chicken pieces, turn to coat, then cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. If time allows, marinate the chicken for up to 24 hours because the buttermilk promotes tenderness. Place flour in a shallow platter. Season it by mixing in salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, paprika, and cayenne. Roll the marinated chicken pieces in the flour, a few at a time, until well coated. Then, dip chicken in the buttermilk bath again followed by another coat of seasoned flour. Allow the chicken to sit in the flour and dry out while preparing the oil, this will help the coating stay on better. The buttermilk will keep absorbing the seasoned flour, which then fries up to form a crunchy crust. Heat oil in a large electric skillet to 350 degrees F. There should be about 1-inch of fat in the pan. Carefully add the chicken pieces in a single layer, skin side down. Do not crowd the pan or the temperature will plummet; make sure the fat continues to bubble around the chicken. Fry for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and fry the other side 5 minutes. Turn again, frying a total of 15 minutes. The turning will produce a golden-crisp skin with even color. Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Do not put hot chicken directly in a bowl or container, the air can not circulate and the steam will cause the crust to fall off. Serve immediately or cool to room temperature. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nCopyright 2000 Television Food Network, G.P.

With a sharp, serrated knife, cut a large \\\\\\\"X\\\\\\\" or cross-hatch pattern into the top of the dough.  Spray lightly with a mister and transfer to the baking stone (or place on a heavy baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal) and bake until golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom, about 60 minutes. (Sourdough should have a darker crust than other breads, so leave in the oven 5 minutes after you think it is done.)  Remove the loaf from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving. \\\\n* In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar.  Let sit until the yeast becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.  (If the yeast does not foam, discard the mixture and begin again with a new yeast.)  Add the flour and stir vigorously to work air into the mixture.  Cover with a towel let rest in a warm, draft-free place (an oven with its pilot light or light bulb turned on works well) for 8 to12 hours.  (The mixture should become very bubbly.)  Use immediately or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. \\\\n* Preserving the Starter: Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.  For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator.  Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days.  Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water. Whisk until blended but not smooth.  Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator.  If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container.  Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it. Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water.  Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using.  CAUTION: Never keep your starter tightly closed!  The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nIn an electric mixer with the dough hook, combine the flour, starter and salt, and knead until it no longer sticks to the sides or bottom of the mixing bowl.  Place a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Sprinkle lightly with flour and knead gently, removing any large air bubbles.  Knead into a small circle, then shape into a tight ball, pinching the seams together underneath.  Place on a well-floured board or baking peel, seam-side down.

Add the onions and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until slightly golden. Add the poblanos and the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more, until the aroma of the garlic is released. Add the tomatoes, fish broth and bay leaf. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the potatoes, bring back to the boil, and decrease the heat so the mixture is simmering. Cover the pan and simmer the soup for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart. Stir in the milk and simmer for 5 minutes more, then add the corn kernels, corn rounds, shrimp, salt and pepper and simmer for an additional 4 minutes. Taste for seasoning and serve in heated bowls, sprinkled with a few leaves of cilantro.  Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins. \\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n### Notes:\\\\n\\\\nc.1997, M.S. Milliken & S.

Process completely, then pour through strainer into another container. Make sure to press out all of the juice, discard lime remains then pour the lime juice back into blender. Again, drop in lime slices, repeating the above process until you have processed all of the limes. Set aside 1 cup of the resulting lime juice. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Blend key lime juice with the sweetened condensed milk. Add the sour cream. In a separate container, beat the eggs, then add to the key lime mixture and beat for 1 minute. Pour mixture into the graham cracker crust. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool pie completely, about 1 hour. Top with whipped topping and put in freezer. Freeze at least 3 hours.

Set aside on a plate or waxed paper. Prepare the batter by mixing the eggs with a whisk, in a large bowl. Add the cream and beer. Whisk to blend. Set aside. In a deep, heavy skillet, heat the oil to 350 degrees. While the oil is heating, prepare the round steaks by dredging them in the flour spice, taking care to evenly coat the meat. Shake off any excess. Dip the meat into the batter, and then again in the flour spice, evenly coating the batter so it is dry on the outside. When the oil temperature reaches 350 degrees (when a drop of batter sizzles when dropped in it), gently slide one steak into the hot oil. Cook the steak about 5 minutes. Turn in, taking care not to break the coating, and cook the meat 5 more minutes, or until the batter is nicely browned. Drain the cooked steak on paper towels. Repeat with the other steaks. Hold the cooked steaks in a 225 degree oven until all 4 are done. Pour Cracked Pepper Gravy over the steaks and serve.\\\\n* Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. When the foam subsides, whisk in the flour. Continually whisk until the flour cooks, becoming a fragrant light brown. Slowly add the milk, continuing to whisk to keep lumps from forming. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer gravy for 10 minutes to cook and reduce. Serve hot.
